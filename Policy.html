        <h3>International Deliveries</h3>
            <p><strong>TAXES & DUTIES</strong></p>
            <p>Orders that are designated for shipment to countries outside of the U.S. may be subject to local taxes, customs, duties, and fees levied by the destination country ["Import Fees"]. The recipient of the shipment is the importer of record in the destination country and is responsible for all Import Fees. If you refuse a shipment from Selkie, you are responsible for the original purchase and shipping charges, any Import Fees that are incurred on the package, and the cost of returning the package to Selkie.</p>
            <p><strong>INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING METHODS AND COSTS</strong></p>
            <p>International orders will be shipped via DHL Express . We do not offer any quicker expedited shipping for international orders other than DHL Express. DHL Express ships within 1-2 business days within Europe and within 3-4 business days in Asia. Selkie is not responsible for delays in shipping or delivery due to force of nature or other uncontrollable events.</p>

            <br>
        <h3>Cancellations/Returns</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, once an order is placed we can no longer make changes.</p>
            <p>At this time we cannot offer cancellations on your order, unless you put the request within 24 hours of a business day, and receive a reply in that time frame.</p>

            <br>
        <h3>Policy</h3>
            <p>We do not produce mass bulk and because of this we offer pre-orders. We cut very small runs of inventory and pre sell many of our best sellers to ensure that each garment is going to someone that loves it. Pre-orders cannot be cancelled after 24 hours as the item has already been sent into production for you.</p>
            <p>Each pre-order item has an estimated shipping time frame listed on the product page. Because of unforeseen production delays, we cannot always guarantee styles will ship in that time frame, but we will do everything in our power to make sure you get your item in a timely fashion. If delays are severe, we will contact you to see if you’d like to keep the delayed pre-order or if you’d like a refund.</p>
            <p>Please note you may also receive your pre-order item much sooner than the estimated date, please be ready to receive your item at any point between your order date and the estimated ship date.</p>
            <p>If your order has in-stock and pre-ordered items, we will ship your in stock item(s) right away and ship your pre-order item(s) when available.</p>

            <br>
        <h3>Sales</h3>
            <p>Selkie offers intermittent sales after inventory is low, if you place an order for an item at full price, it is not eligible for a refund for the difference of the sale price offered later. If you want to try to get your item on sale please sign up for the newsletter. If you buy your item and a sale happens soon after, we cannot refund the price difference- but we do accept returns on full price items for store credit. Please keep in mind certain styles and sizes are popular, and might sell out before a sale period.</p>
            <p>Signature items such as the puff dress do not go on sale.</p>
