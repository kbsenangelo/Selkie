            <p>Fanciful, nostalgic and extra romantic...Meet Selkie! By former Wildfox Co-Founder, <strong>Kimberley Gordon</strong>. <br>This ready-to-wear collection is an imagination driven brand and encourages artistic self expression. Selkie offers a range of stand out party dresses, and after party sweatsuits. With timeless pieces sizes XXS-5X they are made to keep, and pieces you will treasure forever. Selkie is a low waste company, producing small inventories to test the success of items, then using pre-sale to predict how much to buy on popular styles for future rounds. This ensures no dangerous dumping or contribution to landfill.<p>
            <p>Each collection tells a story and presents a dreamy world through its imagery.</p>
            <p>"As a young girl growing up in the UK and then in Santa Barbara, I fell in love with folklore. My love of make believe has infiltrated my work and play for as long as I can remember and ultimately helped inspire my previous clothing line, WILDFOX."</p>
            <p> &nbsp In Irish, Scottish, Icelandic and Scandinavian folklore, the Selkie is a woman of the ocean who lives inside a seal skin. When she comes up to the rocks she slips out of her skin to bask in the sun. If a man is able to steal her skin while she sleeps, she is forced to become his wife and live on land. But, if the selkie finds her skin again, she transforms back into her true form and immediately returns to the sea, free.</p>
            <p>This was Gordon's favorite tale her mom would tell her as a child, and after losing Wildfox, during her darkest moments, she remembered it. "I thought, it's a new beginning story, this is kind of like the second chapter," she explains. "And I thought, there have to be so many women out there who want to find themselves, or are looking for themselves again, and maybe this company can be a representation of my age group, who are looking for joy later on." Like the selkies of folklore, Gordon found her skin and regained control of her life. Now, she's free.</p>

              <h3>Tell me more...</h3>
              <p>Selkie is low waste! We cut very small runs of inventory and pre sell many of our best sellers to ensure that each garment is going to someone that loves it. We do not produce mass bulk. Some garments have only 15-20 ever made! This is why sizes sell out quickly and our fans are fast to shop each drop.</p>
              <p>Selkie is not 100% sustainable due to the use of polyester, but we are consciously committed to finding environmental ways to evolve- and not just as a marketing ploy. Fabric impact is complicated, we encourage you to research different fabrications and their impacts on the environment- all fabrics have an impact unless they are vintage, so it's hard to avoid. But with pressure from you on brands you love, the more we can collectively change the way factories treat their fabrics and begin to lower the expensive price tag attached to sustainable practice.</p>
              <p>With every collection we aim to improve our footprint. Going sustainable is expensive (without mass production), which makes it hard to balance while maintaining a good price for you, our customer! With growth and purchasing power we get closer to affording our environmental goals.</p>
